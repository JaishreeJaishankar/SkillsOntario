# Week 4 Objective

The main objective of week4 is to add visual layer to our node.js application, restructure Terraform code to use modules and segregate app and infra deployments.  Moreover, the next step in the infra provisioning is to introduce Terragrunt and higher granularity of the deployment process.

## Week 4 tasks

- [Basic Koa with EJS tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-hello-world-application-with-koa#step-3-adding-routing-and-view-rendering)
- [Koa with EJS sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/koa-ejs-example-jbcx2?file=/views/main.ejs)
- [Terragrunt vs Branches vs Workspaces](<https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-multiple-environments-with-terraform-32c7bc5d692>)

1. Add visualization layer to node.js app
2. Integrate the deployments, have running monolithic application
3. Segregate app deployment from infra deployment
4. Modularize infra depoyment
5. Add state encryption and TF state lock with DynamoDB
